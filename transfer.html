      <p><a href="https://www.sophia.org">Sophia Learning</a> is a self-paced, open-book online education platform that offers a variety of course (mostly general education courses) for credit. 
        Courses provided by Sophia are accessible through a montly subscription. While you can work on 2 courses simultaneously, there are no limits on the amount of courses you can finish within a month. 
        Certain courses can be finished in less than a day!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Good for Gen Ed Categories: GA (Art), GS (Social Science), GH (Humanities), GN (Natural Science), GQ (Quantification), GHW (Health and Wellness), US (US Culture), IL (International Culture)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Type: Self-Paced</strong></p>

    <h2>Cost</h2>
    <p>The Sophia subscription costs $99 per month. However, the platform frequently runs promotions at the start of each month for a discounted rate off your subscription for the first month. 
       Also, since there is no limit to the amount of courses you take in a month, you should work through the coursework when you have a month free. For current PSU students, this most likely will occur during your winter or summer break. </p>
    <h2>Touchstone</h2>
    <p>To efficently progress through the coursework, you should take courses without Touchstones. A Touchstone is an assignment presented in essay format that must be submitted for grading by an instructor. 
        Since course with Touchstones may take a week to grade, it cuts down on your time to accomplish as many courses as you can in a month. 
        To complete certain gen ed requirements, it may be unavoidable to take a course with a Touchstone. For example in order to finish the US culture requirement, you must take US History I or US History II which each have one touchstone</p>
    <h2>Transfer</h2>
    <p>You can explore other course equivalencies on Sophia by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Search Google for Penn State Transfer Credit Tool </li>
        <li>Click on the Transfer Credit Tool</li>
        <li>Opt for Search by Institution.</li>
        <li>Under Institution, enter: American Council on Education (DC): 100138677.</li>
        <li>For Course, enter: SOPH - SOPHIA LEARNING (ALL Courses).</li>
        <li>Finally, click on Search </li>
    </ol>      
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>The Intro To Nutrition courses transfers as a GHA (not a GHW). However, unlike the other ones in this list, I am confident this transfers as GHW. Although the macroeconomics Sophia course transfers properly as ECON 104, the microeconomics Sophia course does not (ECON XFRGS0). Keep this in mind if your major requires ECON 102.
        The foreign language courses transfer as SPAN XFR000 3 credit course not as SPAN 1, SPAN 2 etc. Also, new Sophia courses will not be in the course equivalency table. Thus, for all these courses it is espeecially important to talk to your advisor to see if they transfer as intended before taking these courses. </p>

      <p>The <a href = "https://clep.collegeboard.org/">College-Level Examination Program (CLEP)</a> offers a set of exams that allow you to gain college credit for your bachelor's degree, bypassing the need to take longer courses. These CLEP tests encompass various fields such as history and social sciences, literature and composition, mathematics and science, business, as well as world languages.</p>
      <p><strong>Good for Foreign Language: Spanish, French, and German</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Good for Certain General Education Coursework</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Type: Exam</strong></p>

    <h2>Cost</h2>
    <p> CLEP exams are administered year-round on a flexible schedule. Exams cost $93 plus your test center or remote proctoring administration fee.
        Unlike Sophia though, CLEP exams can be free. 
        Modern States is an organization that offers free online courses to help you prepare for CLEP exams. These courses are designed to provide comprehensive content review and test preparation materials, allowing you to learn the material that will be tested on the CLEP exams. 
        The courses are delivered through videos, reading materials, practice questions, and other resources.
        After you finish the course, they offer free vouchers to cover the cost of CLEP exam fees for you. 
        These vouchers can be obtained by completing the corresponding Modern States course and passing the associated practice exam. 
        Once you have completed the course and demonstrated their readiness through the practice exam, you can use the voucher to register for the corresponding CLEP exam for free.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>You can potentially earn 12 credits of a foreign language. This is great for students who have a major program that requires a level 3 proficiency in a singular foreign language. Also, the microeconomics exam transfers as ECON 102 unlike Sophia.</p>

  <h2>Cost</h2>
    <p> Study.com's plan costs $235 per month. With this plan you are able to take 2 exams. Each subsequent exam afterwards is $70 up to a total of 5 exams. Although more expensive than the other options, so far, this is most likely the cheapest way to get credit for ENGL 15. </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>You must take both ENGLISH 104 COLLEGE COMP I and ENGLISH 105 COLLEGE COMP II for ENGL 15 credit to be awarded. Although COMM 101: PUBLIC SPEAKING transfers as CAS XFR100, this is not CAS 100A/B. You should talk to your advisor before taking this course for this credit. </p>
