      <p><a href="https://www.sophia.org">Sophia Learning</a> is a self-paced, open-book online education platform that offers a variety of course (mostly general education courses) for credit. 
        Courses provided by Sophia are accessible through a montly subscription. While you can work on 2 courses simultaneously, there are no limits on the amount of courses you can finish within a month. 
        Certain courses can be finished in less than a day!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Good for Gen Ed Categories: GA (Art), GS (Social Science), GH (Humanities), GN (Natural Science), GQ (Quantification), GHW (Health and Wellness), US (US Culture), IL (International Culture)</strong></p>

    <h2>Cost</h2>
    <p>The Sophia subscription costs $99 per month. However, the platform frequently runs promotions at the start of each month for a discounted rate off your subscription for the first month. 
       Also, since there is no limit to the amount of courses you take in a month, you should work through the coursework when you have a month free. For current PSU students, this most likely will occur during your winter or summer break. </p>
    <h2>Touchstone</h2>
    <p>To efficently progress through the coursework, you should take courses without Touchstones. A Touchstone is an assignment presented in essay format that must be submitted for grading by an instructor. 
        Since course with Touchstones may take a week to grade, it cuts down on your time to accomplish as many courses as you can in a month. 
        To complete certain gen ed requirements, it may be unavoidable to take a course with a Touchstone. For example in order to finish the US culture requirement, you must take US History I or US History II which each have one touchstone</p>
    <h2>Transfer</h2>
    <p>You can explore other course equivalencies on Sophia by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Search Google for Penn State Transfer Credit Tool </li>
        <li>Click on the Transfer Credit Tool</li>
        <li>Opt for Search by Institution.</li>
        <li>Under Institution, enter: American Council on Education (DC): 100138677.</li>
        <li>For Course, enter: SOPH - SOPHIA LEARNING (ALL Courses).</li>
        <li>Finally, click on Search </li>
    </ol>      
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>The Intro To Nutrition courses transfers as a GHA (not a GHW). Although the macroeconomics Sophia course transfers properly as ECON 104, the microeconomics Sophia course does not (ECON XFRGS0). Keep this in mind if your major requires ECON 102.
        The foreign language courses transfer as SPAN XFR000 3 credit course not as SPAN 1, SPAN 2 etc. Also, new Sophia courses will not be in the course equivalency table. Thus, for all these courses it is especially important to talk to your advisor to see if they transfer as intended before taking these courses. 
        If you need an interdomain, you can try to petition environmental science as an interdomain because it is both a social science and a natural science. </p>
