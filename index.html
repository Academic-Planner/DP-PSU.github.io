      <p><a href="https://www.sophia.org">Sophia Learning</a> is a self-paced, open-book online education platform that offers a variety of course (mostly general education courses) for credit. 
        Courses provided by Sophia are accessible through a montly subscription. While you can work on 2 courses simultaneously, there are no limits on the amount of courses you can finish within a month. 
        Certain courses can be finished in less than a day!</p>

    <h2>Cost</h2>
    <p>The Sophia subscription costs $99 per month. However, the platform frequently runs promotions at the start of each month for a discounted rate off your subscription for the first month. 
       Also, since there is no limit to the amount of courses you take in a month, you should work through the coursework when you have a month free. For current PSU students, this most likely will occur during your winter or summer break. </p>
    <h2>Genral Education Courses</h2>
      <p><strong>Quantification (GQ):</strong> MATH 140, STAT 100</p>
      <p><strong>Arts (GA): </strong>ARTH 111, ARTH 112, GD XFRGA</p>
      <p><strong>Humanities (GH):</strong>HIST 20, HIST 21, PHIL 10, PHIL 3, PHIL XFRGH0, ENGL XFRGH</p>
      <p><strong>Social Science (GS): </strong> SOC 1, PLSC 1, PSYCH 100, ECON 104, ECON GS0</p>
      <p><strong>Naturial Science (GN): </strong> BIOL 161, MICRB 106, BISC 4, CHEM 101, ENVSC XFRGN0</p>
      <p><strong>Health & Wellness (GHW): </strong>NUTR XFRGHA</p>
    <h2>Touchstone</h2>
    <p>To efficently progress through the coursework, you should avoid taking courses with Touchstones. However, for some requirements, it is inevitable to take certain coursework. A Touchstone is an assignment presented in essay format that must be submitted for grading by an instructor. 
          Since course with Touchstones may take a week to grade, it cuts down on your time to accomplish as many courses as you can in a month. 
          To complete certain gen ed requirements, it may be unavoidable to take a course with a Touchstone. </p>
    <h2>Transfer</h2>
    <p>You can explore other course equivalencies on Sophia by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Searching Google for Penn State Transfer Credit Tool </li>
        <li>Click on the Transfer Credit Tool</li>

    </ol>
    <h2>How to Send Transcript</h2>
    <p>First, you can not send a transcript through Sophia directly with Parchment, you must send it through Credly. You can create an account through credly. Once you finish your Sophia course, you have to click "Get Your Badge." In your credly account, you should see your badge appear. You can follow this  <a href="https://support.credly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054195272-How-can-I-send-my-ACE-Transcript">link</a> for steps on how to send your transcript to admissions@psu.edu.
       It would also be helpful to put your psu email (in case you did not sign up with your psu email) and student id number in the custom message to ease the transfer process.</p>      
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p> Although the Intro To Nutrition courses transfers as a GHA in the tool (not a GHW), it does in fact transfer as a GHW that can satisfy the GHW 3 credit (not interdomain) requirement. Although the macroeconomics Sophia course transfers properly as ECON 104, the microeconomics Sophia course does not. Keep this in mind if your major requires ECON 102 or ECON 104 or both.
        The Spanish foreign language courses transfer as SPAN XFR000, a 3 credit course - not as SPAN 1, SPAN 2 etc. New Sophia courses will not show up on the transfer credit tool. Thus, for these courses it is especially important to talk to your advisor to see if they transfer as intended before taking the course
        If you need an interdomain, you can try to petition, with prior approval (talk to your advisor), environmental science as an interdomain and argue it is both a social science and a natural science. Note that petitioning for an interdomain only works for an XFR course. With clever petitioning for interdomain coursework, it may be possible to finish your core general education requirements with Sophia Learning.</p>

These tests encompass various fields such as social sciences, literature and composition, technology, and business.</p>
      <p><strong>Good for Specific Courses Listed Below:</strong></p>

      Upper Level TECEP Exams (3000-4000) (tests for IST 220 and PSYCH 270 only) cost $77 per credit or $231 for a 3 credit course. 
      In order to take the TECEP exam, you must apply to the university as a non-matriculated student interested in taking TECEP exams only. 
      The application fee (a one time fee) is $50. </p>

    </ol>      
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Penn State has a transfer policy as follows "Only courses in which a grade of 'C' (2.0) or higher is earned will be considered for transfer. Course work completed on a Pass/Fail or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis typically will not be transferred, unless the transcript indicates the alternative grade is equivalent to 'C' (2.0) or higher." Therefore, you may have to tell admissions that TESU indicated the alternative grade given is equivalent to 'C' (2.0) or higher when submitting your transcript. You can view this <a href = "https://www.degreeforum.net/mybb/Thread-Technical-Writing-TECEP-My-Experience?pid=415185#pid415185">link</a> for more information. </p>

    The MATH 220 (3 credit) course offered by Westcott called Linear Algebra is 4 credits. 
    If you do take this course, in addition to MATH 220 course, you would be given miscallanous MATH credit (1).
    From my understanding, the MATH 220 course at Penn State is relatively easy while the MATH 230 course at Penn State is quite harder.
    If you are an independent learner who likes to learn online, these courses might be for you.
